The first problem involves normalizing the features for your training and test data.

Implement Min-Max scaling in the `normalize()` function to a range of `a=0.1` and `b=0.9`. After scaling, the values of the pixels in the input data should range from 0.1 to 0.9.

Since the raw notMNIST image data is in [grayscale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale), the current values range from a min of 0 to a max of 255.

Min-Max Scaling:
$
X'=a+{\frac {\left(X-X_{\min }\right)\left(b-a\right)}{X_{\max }-X_{\min }}}
$

#Traffic sign classifier
---
Goal of this project is to train a convolutional neural network to classify traffic sign images using german traffic sings [dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).

###Dataset exploration

This dataset consisnts of 51Â 839 labeled 32x32 RGB images, which we split into three sets for training, validation and testing:

- Training Set:   34799 samples
- Validation Set: 4410 samples
- Test Set:       12630 samples
